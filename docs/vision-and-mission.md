# Vision & Mission

## What Text-to-Chain Is About

**Text-to-Chain** is an SMS-based DeFi platform that brings Web3 to everyone through simple text messages. No smartphone, no app, no MetaMask. Just the device and channel that billions already use every day, and often just can.

We exist because **onboarding has been unaffordable**: not in money alone, but in devices, connectivity, literacy in crypto UIs, and access to the formal financial rails that crypto assumes. For **2.5 billion feature-phone users**—and many more who are underbanked or excluded—the “right” to own assets, move value, and participate in global finance has been out of reach. We change that by meeting people where they are: **SMS**.

## Vision

A world where **financial sovereignty and participation in global value flows are universal rights**, not privileges of those who can afford smartphones, stable internet, or familiarity with wallets and gas fees.

We envision a future where anyone with a basic phone and a text plan can **join**, **hold**, **send**, **swap**, **bridge**, and **cash out**—without ever touching a browser extension or a dApp. The chain becomes as simple as a conversation.

## Mission

To **bring the right to the world** by making Web3 onboarding **unaffordable no longer**: we use the most universal interface—text—to remove the technical and economic barriers that have kept billions excluded.

We do this by:

- **Meeting people where they are** — SMS and feature phones, not smartphones and app stores.
- **Hiding complexity, keeping sovereignty** — users get wallets, ENS identities, and DeFi actions via simple commands; the stack stays decentralized and user-controlled.
- **Leveraging impossible angles** — solving problems that seem intractable (e.g. “no smartphone, no crypto”) by redefining the interface and the assumptions. We don’t wait for the world to get better devices or better networks; we make the existing ones enough.

## Why “Impossible Angles”

Change at scale often fails when we only improve what’s already there—faster apps, cheaper smartphones, better UX for the same users. **Text-to-Chain takes an impossible angle**: treat the constraint (SMS, feature phones, low bandwidth) as the design center. By building DeFi that works over text, we unlock populations and use cases that were written off as “not yet ready.” That’s how we **truly bring change**—not by making the same thing slightly better, but by making the previously impossible **possible** for the people who need it most.

*Bringing Web3 to everyone, simple as that.*
